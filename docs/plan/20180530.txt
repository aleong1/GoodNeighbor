Plans:

Crucial jobs:
-Fixing up proposal
-Implementing the classes (check to do list for order)
-Coming up with situations/scenarios

Core components:
-Crimes, CallCenter,Burglar classes

Prereq components:
CallCenter needs: Crime, Burglar, Equipment, 
Jake needs: Crime

Individual tasks vs collaborative tasks:
Collaborative: Implementing the superclasses that won't really be 'replicated'
Individual: Comming up with scenarios, implementing subclasses that are similar to each other (ex. all the crime subclasses)
