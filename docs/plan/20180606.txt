Plan for 06-06-2018

Crucial jobs:
Get a basic version of the game in the terminal. The user would be able to
instantiate the game, get calls about crimes throughout the day, and rank the
order in which they wish to solve these crimes at certain time intervals.

Core functionality:
- basic game should function in response to user input and solve crimes
according to the priority the user ranks these crimes
- crimes come into call center, user can choose busters and equipment to assist
with crime. If right busters chosen, Jake gets a bonus; if wrong busters chosen,
Jake gets a detraction from his salary (points). Choosing the right equipment
will increase points, wrong equipment will have no effect on points (but time
will be lost choosing equipment). User does not have to choose busters or
equipment.
- equipment mini-game
- extremity is random value in interval(1, difficulty + 2)
- typing and timing
- timer running on screen

Non-essentials:
- may want to make a user interface with processing after basic game in terminal
is made
- funny dialogue, funny calls
- people with powers

Prerequisite Components:
- For Jake, need CallCenter to function and interactions to be written
- each Crime has its own time, and then there is a general timer
- equipment, busters, and crimes all written before CallCenter

Tasks:
Collaborative:
- CallCenter
  - timing functionality, equipment mini-game

Delegated:
- Interactions, Situations
