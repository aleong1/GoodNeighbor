                                           Police Chase: "Will You Be There?"
                                           
### Description of Project
We are making a police chase simulator where over the course of 1 day the player will play as a police officer (Jake) and try to solve various crimes throughout a city in order to look good for a promotion and to get that bonus ($$). There will be three levels of increasing difficulty. The crimes will all have different extremities, and the player will choose what order to deal with them by taking in various factors like how many police cars are needed, if there needs to be any other assistance, what equipment to bring, etc. The player will place each crime as it comes into a position in a priority queue.

### How the Project Works
The user starts off each day with police Chief Flo who will give a messsage to Jake every morning. Jake will have three choices of ways to respond to the Chief and picking the right one gives a boost in how much time Jake has to solve crimes. The wrong answer will deduct time. Jake then has until midday to solve as many crimes as he can until Flo checks up on him again. While solving the crimes, Jake has the option to ask for help from the Busters (FBI, IRS, Towing Company, etc.) or to get more equipment(pencil, cruiser, handcuffs, etc.). However, the more help he gets, the more time gets deducted. After his midday interaction with the chief, Jake has until the end of the day to solve more crimes with the same options to get help. At the end of the day, Jake encounters the Chief once again at the station for another interaction. Selecting more of the right reactions will give Jake a higher chance of getting a promotion.
